### setup
install pip requirements

### step 1. create inventory
```
Inventories organize managed nodes in centralized files that provide Ansible with system information and network locations. 
Using an inventory file, Ansible can manage a large number of hosts with a single command.
```

### step 2. verify it 
```
ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --list
ansible myhosts -m ping -i inventory.ini -u <username on targets>
```

### step 3. create playbook
```
Playbooks are automation blueprints, in YAML format, that Ansible uses to deploy and configure managed nodes.

Playbook
- A list of plays that define the order in which Ansible performs operations, from top to bottom, to achieve an overall goal.

Play
- An ordered list of tasks that maps to managed nodes in an inventory.

Task
- A reference to a single module that defines the operations that Ansible performs.

Module
- A unit of code or binary that Ansible runs on managed nodes. Ansible modules are grouped in collections with a Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN) for each module.
```

### step4. verify it
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yaml -u <username on targets>
```
